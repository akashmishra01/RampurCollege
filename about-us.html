 <h3><b> RAMPUR COLLEGE HISTORY</b></h3>
  <p>Rampur Education Society was originally named as Nakaulevu Indian School in 1942
and Pt Vishnu Deo (OBE) helped people as advisor for the school formation. Vishnu
Nath Prasad and Shankar Nar Singh were the proposers.
They called a meeting of farmers of Nakaulevu to have a school of their own. Before
they had a Seventh Day Adventist School which closed in late 1930 and ther was no school in this area.<br>
<br>
The people agreed to this proposal and approacehd Pt Lala Prasad Sardar also known
as Mackey for land. Mr Mackey agreed to rent out 5 acres of land to the school. The
rent at that point of time was 1 shilling per acre. The people made an effort to build
a school and their first building was a "bure" and the floor was of gravel and this was
in 1941.The school officially opened in 1942 with the name Nakaulevu Bhartiya Pathsala.
The name of the school was later changed to Nakaulevu Indian School. There were no desks or chairs 
and there was only one teacher, Mr Sukhai Ram Udit.<br>
<br>
J.P.Bailey bought all of Mr Mackay's land becuase the land where the school was in 1948 got
subdivided and sold tofarmers. The School Committee received a notice to vacate the land, so the
Committee started looking for a land to rebuild the school. Then Vishnu Nath Prasad offered land
in Viwawa Road. The Committee then develped the land by digging the drains, etc. Mr Hari Singh
offered one acre land for rent where the school is currently located. The school got its name
'Rampur' since the indentured labourers used to have Ram Lila on that particular location.
Later Mr Hari Singh donated another half an acre of land so the school could be built. The school
was re-opened in 1953. The School Committee photocopied the letter of donation from Sitla Prasad
Vyas, a priest of India to erect the school in memory of Hari Singh.Later someone broke into the 
school premises and stole the letter of donation. So late in 1950, Hari Singh gave notice to vacate 
the land by his lawyer, and then the School Committee produced the original letter of donation.<br>
<br>
Mr Hari Singh gave a notice to the School Committee to vacate the premises as the school play-
ground was creating drainage problems. He felt that a drain through the school compound would
solve this problem. The Committee hired a civil engineer, Mr Tetzaner, to see if a drain was needed
and it was adviced against the blockage. Mr Hari Singh forcefully dug a drain across the playground
which made the School Committee take legal action.Then the School Trustees took legal action and claimed 
damages plus the cost of hiring the law firm of K.C.Ramrakha & Company. Mr Hari Singh hired almost 5 lawyers 
to fight the case against the School.<br>
<br>
Hari Singh used all his cash for hiring lawyers for the case so he asked the settlement for help
because he was unable to pay the costs. On 25/09/1964, the High Court Chamber gave its rulig
through Justice Hammetin favour of the School for Hari Singh to pay all the damages to the School.
Since he did not have any money left, he then gave 5 acres of land to the school to settle the case.
The Board then arranged Mr Tetzaner (Surveyor) to survey the land and the School Board then got
the Title CT 11686 for the land on 09/03/1965. The later on, the trustees bought more land for the
school in 1985-CT 30868.<br>
<br>
In the AGM held on 05/11/1975, the people of Nakaulevu proposed the change of the name from
Nakaulevu Indian School to Rampur Education Education Society incorporating Rampur Primary
School and Rampur College. Then in 1978, the High School was opened and the first Principal was
Mr Aedi Narayan.Then the Constitution of Rampur Education Society was written by Master Ram Narayan Govind
(please refer to the Constitution Appendix for the founders of Rampur Education Society).
The Constitution was adopted on 25/09/1994 and was registered on 06/12/1994 at the Registrar of
Titles - Title No. 386.</p>
